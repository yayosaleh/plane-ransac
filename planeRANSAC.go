		- Unlike the remaining stages of the pipeline, this function is given a receive-only control channel, stop,
		  which is populated by TakeN(). This is necessary since the termination of this stage depends on a later
		  stage in the pipeline, rather than a previous one.
		- When stop is sent a value, the output channel of this function, randomPointStream, is closed, and initiates
		  the termination cascade of the pipeline (i.e., TripletGenerator terminates when randomPointStream is closed, and so on...)


		Random point generation:

		Need to produce random ints in the range [0, n), where n is the size of the point cloud,
		in order to index the provided slice.

		We want different random numbers everytime we run, so we'll set the seed based on the current time;
		however; when trying to optimize the number of threads, we won't set the seed so the random
		points generated are a control variable.

		The select statement below will block until 'stop' has been sent a value, causing the
		goroutine to terminate, OR until randomPointStream's value has been received, at which point we
